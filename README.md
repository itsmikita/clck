# `clck`

URL-shortener CLI-script for macOS Terminal. May also work on Linux, not yet tested.

## How-to

Clone the repo and run the build script like so:

```shell
bun install && bun build
```

It will put the script into ´/usr/share/bin´. Reload the Terminal window and you can now run:

```shell
clck https://your-url-to-be-shorten.xyz
```

To retrieve the shorten URL.
